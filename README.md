# How cats work

* I am a frontend developer *

I have worked on this problem, by implementing front end features like displaying the cards and having drag and drop feature for the same.
I have created simple components, that made the entire application and each component is isolated and can be reused anywhere.
For me Mocking the APIs was the first time and I have used official docs to set up APIs and implemented the same in the frontend.
